A review of current events: How I'm worse than an altraider
---

The day before yesterday, on August 21, I was pearled by Commonwealth. The crime: Breaking 4 workbenches.

[I'll start by saying I admit to all crimes as charged.](https://youtu.be/wMLB3OeVfH4)
What I am arguing is Commonwealth's sentencing.

## [The raid](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivCommonwealth/comments/6v8ifd/topwolf_v_onii_san/)

During that day, I entered Commonwealth using questionable means to remove the workbenches from every hourse.
The operation was going well, and I had managed to hit the market and several tens of private houses.
I eventually entered TheTopWolf's building and exp shop, where I proceded to liberate the crafting tables, like I had in the rest of the houses in the commonwealth.
I entered the private factory area of the shop to break a crafting table I saw inside. 
Notably, I did not break the crafting tables of the factories, because that would be real theft.
While I was breaking the workbenches inside the shop, I was witnessed by daddy1015. He claims that he thought I was raiding,
even though I only broke the workbenches and ignored numerous factories and exp chest shops.
Daddy alerted TopWolf and some pvper in commonwealth, and after breaking into a few more houses and evading [daddy's taunts, which broke my junk prot chestplate](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/236326157899923456/349409336130404352/unknown.png), I got pearled.
Reports of the handling of my items are unclear, however the significant items I lost were Axe-chan #9, a u3e4 diamond axe, and 82 workbenches.

## [The CosmoCopper Incident](https://www.reddit.com/r/civclassics/comments/6v8oqn/bewsiej_cosmocopper_is_raiding_commonwealth_and/)

After I was pearled, [a thread was created in the commonwealth subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivCommonwealth/comments/6v8ifd/topwolf_v_onii_san/).
In this thread, I argued my defense. Poortea gave an ultimatum I had no control over: Free me within the hour or I'll be freed by force.
This ultimatum was mostly intended for one thing, to prompt pvp action. 
Bewsiej and poortea both will do anything to pvp anyone, regardless of the possible consequences.
I did not object to their ultimatum, however if I did I'd've certainly been ignored. 
In addition, the US operates on a strict yesocracy:
The people who say yes to poortea and agree with him the most get the highest share of prot, diamonds, and generalized wealth.

When the hour had passed, either bewsiej or crackerjack logged onto CosmoCopper and proceeded to break into the bunker where my pearl was being temporarily stored.
It isn't entirely clear who was logged onto CosmoCopper, and reports are conflicting. 
Thus, I'll avoid that topic, and leave figuring out the true identity of CosmoCopper to the commonwealth. 
After CosmoCopper broke into the bunker, he started To break the one layer of DRO around my pearl chest before being chased off
by tankbuster and a few other pvpers.
CosmoCopper took shelter in a lexington bunker, where his persuers tried to break into, nullifying any possible claims for broken obby.

Commonwealth claims they will permapearl CosmoCopper if they catch him. I support commonwealth fully in this claim.

## I'm worse than an altraider: The sentence

Just today, after two days of begging for a formal sentence, I was notified that my pearl will be released Friday. 
This totals 6 days my pearl will be heald, more than altraiders including parker and bewsiej, who got 5 days each.
Commonwealth claims that by not telling CosmoCopper to stop, I supported my unpearling, 
and that I'd've gotten hours of punishment instead of a punishment worse than altraiders. 
However, I had no control over CosmoCopper, and the crimes I commited were petty at best, and effectively meaningless.
It takes one log to craft one workbench. In addition, I only broke one iron reinforced block, a workbench. 
Thus, the reperations I owe personaly total less than one diamond. Commonwealth has not asked for any reperations of any sort.
Meanwhile, CosmoCopper did not successfully break me out, and it is my understanding that he did not kill anyone nor engage
in pvp, requiring no reps for prot damage. 
Thus, even assuming that daddy's bunker was 2 layers thick DRO, damages CosmoCopper did would total less than 6 diamonds.

No matter what way you look at things, the punishment does not fit the crime. 
While CosmoCopper is probably a valid permapearl, I do not disserve 6 days pearling for the accusation of breaking 4 workbenches.
Once again, I admit to all crimes as charged, however, the crimes I am charged of are not fitting of the punishment.
