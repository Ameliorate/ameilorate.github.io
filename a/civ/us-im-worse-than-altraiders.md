A review of the US: How I'm still worse than an altraider
---

The day before yesterday, on September 17, I was pearled by poortea. The crime: Arguing for my workbench breaking rights.

I'll start by saying I admit to all crimes as charged. What I am arguing is poortea's sentencing. 

## The raid

A few days prior to my pearling, I went to commonwealth for a few errands,
including buying all the workbenches from the shops and sorrounding area for free.
[I mostly succeeded in this task.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ameliorate/ameliorate.github.io/master/a/civ/CommonwealthInv.png)
I eventually fell to my death and respawned in the US, across the map and in the inverse quadrant as Commonwealth.
Because of that, I asked meow to retreive my items, which I assume meow did, given that they've never having my items.
Meow logged off for the night, and I later made it to Commonwealth and logged Oniii_Chan there,
in order to easily get back my items tomorow.
In the next day, I asked meow for my items, and meow gave the excuse that he'd have to discuss it with others.
The following day and the next few, I asked for my items with either no answer or a negative answer.
Eventually, I gave Commonwealth and meow an ultamatim: Either give me my items or record themselves throwing my items into lava.
I did not want to support Commonwealth after their treatment and punishment for my petty actions in Commonwealth a month ago,
so I gave them the option of destroying the items.

I was eventually given the option of writing an essay for *the chance* at my items,
if they had not been destroyed by the time I wrote the essay. 
The offer fell through when I accepted the offer with the condition that if my items were destroyed,
the destruction would be filmed and posted on youtube.

Included in the items of mine in meow's presumed possesion are Axe-chan #12 and a few assorted level 30 enchanted diamond tools.

This, however, is not what this article is about. 

## The debate incident

On September 16th was the date of the Southshire council election. I joined VC a few minutes before the debates began,
but the real debate was in the #general channel.
Just before the debates began, I was asked a question I do not remember but the answer was
"Amelorate: I can steal whatever workbenches I want."
I then argued some fluff about having a given right to workbenches, as well as jokingly pinging @meow asking for Axe-chan #12 back.
A few people took the bait, and I debated with them for a while, eventually forming the argument that workbench
infiltrating is like white-hat hacking. I was pointing out vulnerabilities in people's houses by breaking in.
This was in counterargument to the idea that I was making raiding easy, by already breaking into houses.
However, I do not break into bunkers, and all of the houses I have broken into have taken me less than 5 minutes at most to get inside.
I do not break chests either, and I avoid breaking factories if I can. 

Eventually, poortea randomly came in and said I was removed from vault groups, with no context given.
I continued debating and poortea eventually said I was kicked out of the US.
Following standard protocol for being kicked out of a nation, I logged onto Oniii_San inside of the US, 
and was nearly instantly killed. I was inside the bunker blocks away from my personal chests, but on a different Y level. 
I did not see poortea in the short time I was killed either.
Luckilly, I was not pearled, and I had my bed set in Lexington at the time.
Poortea said at the time he was popping my personal chests, but I was unable to figure out for sure if it was one
of poortea's many jokes, so I ignored it.
After talking to Saren_Solaris a bit, I was invited to Southshire,
nearby to the Commonwealth where I had Oniii_Chan logged for a few days then.
I took a short rail, where Saren led me to his floating castle, an exact replica to the one I found elsewhere.


## Oniii_Chan pearled, post claims (by Saren_Solaris, 1 comment)

After running and jumping for a while, talking to Saren, he pointed a bow at me saying along the lines that he must do this.
At the time I assumed it was a formality of becoming a Southshire citizen, clearing yourself of any claims.
He killed and pearled me in one hit, and there I was pearled for 24 hours while Saren tried to gather claims from the
many people I had gotten workbenches from. Naturally, nobody except poortea pressed claims, and I had not stolen
crafting tables from the US in a very long time,
given the fact that I wasn't on bastions and couldn't place temp-benches of my own.

I pinged Saren after a day had passed, and I expected to be freed.
Instead however, I was told that my pearl was being transfered to the US.
I jokingly asked for some serious PvP after I had been pearled with a point-blank bow. 
At first he ignored this request, since I could use that to log out if I was given enough time /ppsummoned or /ppfreed.
However, after a few munutes, Saren stopped, and I was /ppfreed. 
I was then killed, returning me to my bed set in the US skybunker.
Saren later told me that he forgot that I had my bed set in the US skybunker and he was granting me PvP in part to randomspawn me, and that it all was a prank gone wrong. 
However, I had told him earlier that he should /ppfree me while I was online
in order to avoid being spawned into the US skybunker where I had set my bed.
To further invalidate Saren's claims that it was an accident, my pearl being given to poortea,
poortea was right in front of my bed set in the skybunker and killed me barely seconds after I was killed by Saren.
This time, I was pearled and vaulted. At that moment, I was certain I was perma, and poortea later confirmed this.

[I had earlier placed a 300d bounty on poortea,](https://www.reddit.com/r/civclassics/comments/70lo3p/300d_bounty_on_poortea_for_breaking_my_personal/)
and this bounty is still active and is not a meme. I will pay if you pearl poortea.
Poortea broke my personal chests with 128 emerald blocks inside,
and I was not given the chance to get my ExP blocks when I was kicked out of the US.
I am tempted to place a similar bounty on Saren_Solaris after his actions, however I am still in consiteration.

## How I'm still worse than an altraider: The sentence

Poortea told me that there was a trial in two weeks.
Instead the trial was hosted a day later, when I couldn't attend it. 
According to poortea, a number of people from the Commonwealth voted yes to give me 60 IRL years in the end.
I am doubtful of both poortea's jury choice and his sentance, as I have done nothing to poortea.
While poortea claims that his actions are supported by US law,
he never cited any portion of US law, and there was never even a constitution written for the US during the time I was a
member of the US.
I am not being held for any crimes I have commited or heald because anyone with claims on me do not have a vault.
The only people autistic enough to press claims on me for breaking workbenches are Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth has the
hajatland vault for their use, as proved during last month's drama, where I became worse than an altraider.

Poortea punished Parker and Bewsij not at all for their altraiding in Commonwealth,
however I am perma for debating my rights too hard in the Southshire discord.
